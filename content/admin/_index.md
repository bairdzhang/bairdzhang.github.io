I am a 4-th year Ph.D. student in Computer Science Department at the Johns Hopkins University, under the supervision of [Prof. Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). Currently, I am a member of [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning](http://ccvl.jhu.edu). Before that, I obtained Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science Department at the University of Science and Technology of China.
